# Shortest path finder along with the sorting visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented algorithms:
1) Dijkstra Algorithm for shortest path
2) Bubble sort
3) Selection sort
4) Insertion sort
5) Merge sort
6) Quick sort
7) Heap sort
   

Features:
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
  1.1) Blue:default
  1.2) Yellow: Being compared
  1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  1.4) Green: In correct position
2) 3 Controls for visualizations
  2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  2.2) Data size ()
  2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
